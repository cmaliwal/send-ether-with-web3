## Requirements

- Node.js 8.4.0

## Setup

Install the dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn`

Then, create a file named `.env` and save it to the root directory of the project. This file will hold your sensitive credentials and will be ignored by the Git repository, so it won't be uploaded or shared anywhere.


### .env

INFURA_ACCESS_TOKEN=xxxxxx
 
WALLET_ADDRESS=xxxxxx
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=xxxxxx
 
DESTINATION_WALLET_ADDRESS=xxxxxx


### Run Command on your terminal :
node ./index.js
