## Requirements

- Node.js 8.4.0

## Setup

Install the dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn`

Then, create a file named `.env` and save it to the root directory of the project. This file will hold your sensitive credentials and will be ignored by the Git repository, so it won't be uploaded or shared anywhere.





### Run Command on your terminal :
node ./index.js
